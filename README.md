A fully working build is available on the Metaquest 3E Headset.
Custom (modified) wav file was imported, and a simple prop was made from scratch (within UE5).

Premise: 
There is a red target for the player to hit. 
If the player hits the target using the metal pipe, 
the player is rewarded with a sound of the metal pipe striking the target,
and the target randomizes its position within the grid of cubes
for the player to find and strike again. 
(I'm very proud of the target randomization BP working first try)

Additional Notes:
I would have added more elements to spruce up the level layout, 
but every build iteration required a PC restart as well as a 
Quest 3 manual uninstallation and reinstallation. This was needed for
EVERY time I made any modification in the UE5 Project.
